Using either git pull or git fetch + git rebase will both result into having the same content added to your worktree but there are the 
following points to be noted:

--Advantage of fetch + rebase is that It will preserve a linear looking commits history instead of having multiple branch bubbles 
look in case of using pull

--On the other hand its not recommended to use rebase on remote branches as changing other people's commits history is considered
to be bad practice
 



Also, note that "git pull --rebase" can also be used as an equivalent to fetch + rebase
